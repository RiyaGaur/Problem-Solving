The factorial of the integer n, written n!, is defined as:<br>
<t><t>n!=nX(n-1)X(n-2)X...X3X2X1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if n=30, we calculate 30X29X28X...X2X1 and get 265252859812191058636308480000000.

<h2> Function Description </h2>

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):
<ul>
  <li> n: an integer </li>
</ul>
<strong>Note:</strong> Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
