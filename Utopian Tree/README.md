The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is n=5, the calculations are as follows:

Period  Height
0          1<br>
1          2<br>
2          3<br>
3          6<br>
4          7<br>
5          14

<h2>Function Description</h2>

Complete the utopianTree function in the editor below. It should return the integer height of the tree after the input number of growth cycles.

utopianTree has the following parameter(s):
<ul>
    <li>n: an integer, the number of growth cycles to simulate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input Format</h2>

The first line contains an integer,t, the number of test cases.
t subsequent lines each contain an integer,n, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1 <= t <= 10</li>
    <li> 0 <= n <= 60</li>
</ul>

<h2>Output Format</h2>

For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after n cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>

3<br>
0<br>
1<br>
4

<h2>Sample Output</h2>

1<br>
2<br>
7
